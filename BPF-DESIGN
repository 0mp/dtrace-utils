BPF MAPS
--------
Local variable storage
	array map (indexed by variable id)

Global and dynamic variable storage
	hash map (indexed by variable name)

Session state
	array map (indexed by state parameter id)

Probe meta data
	array map (indexed by probe id)

Context map
	array map (indexed by CPU id)

PROBE NAME HASHING
------------------
Legacy DTrace currently reports:
	   13 distinct providers
	   84 distinct modules
	42405 distinct functions
	  742 distinct probe names
	88928 distinct probes

Hash by module name, function name, probe name, and mod:func:name.  When doing
a string constant lookup of any element, use the hashtable for that element.
When doing a shell wildcard pattern match, iterate over all hash buckets by
iterating over the hash slots, and for each non-empty hash slot, iterate over
the buckets linked to that slot, applying the wildcard pattern to the string
value for which the bucket was created.

OPERATIONS
----------
    List probes (-l)
    ----------------
	This argument (mutually exclusive with -A, -G, -h, -V) requests a list
	of probes that match the probe specifications found in the provided
	script or command line actions.

	The probe specifications are given in the following format:

		[ [ [ <gstr> : ] <gstr> : ] <gstr> : ] <gstr>

	where
		<gstr> is either a string constant or a shell wildcard pattern
		       (an empty string is the same as a * pattern)

    Version (-V)
    ------------
	This argument (mutually exclusive with -A, -G, -h, -l) is used to
	display the DTrace API version inforamtion.  When verbose output is
	requested (-v), information about the DTrace application version and
	version control identifiers is included as well.
